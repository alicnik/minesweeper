# **_MINESWEEPER_**

A classic game deserving of a classic feel.

## GOAL

To design and implement a faithful reproduction of the classic Windows game Minesweeper, paying tribute not only to the functionality, but also the playing environment.

## HTML

As this was a vehicle for DOM manipulation, the HTML structure is simple with few surprises. There is use of the dataset throughout to facilitate interaction between the script and the HTML.

## CSS

Design was modelled on the classic Windows 95 desktop, with a photo of an old CRT monitor merged with a screenshot of the original desktop layout. A Minesweeper "icon" was added to the desktop for authenticity and additional interaction. To ensure authenticity, user select and cursor: pointer have been removed throughout as a style choice. Borders are inset/outset white 2px throughout, per original game.

Smiley face button designed for this game with influence from Watchmen on game over. Sporadic use of active and hover pseudo-classes to mimic original functionality and UI.

Difficulty buttons "merged" into the plastic of the CRT monitor display for additional visual sugar. Pseudo-elements used in grid (more 3D than border) and on difficult buttons to mimic the cutout of the plastic button.

Simple mobile display with echoes of 90s 'Word Art' in pseudo-element title. Removed one difficulty button as grid too large for mobile displays.

Various classes stipulated to allow for DOM manipulation.

## JAVASCRIPT

### 1. Initial setup

To allow for different board sizes, dynamic grid generation is employed in `drawMinefield()`. The number of tiles and mines is determined by the height, width and mines variables. These can be changed dynamically by clicking the difficulty buttons, with the new values for the variables being taken from each button dataset.

On generation, tiles are assigned CSS classes and a data.index value that keeps track of their order of creation. Event listeners for the primary click events (see below) are added. Tile is pushed to the DOM in `div.grid`.

Tile is also stored as an object in an array with various properties: element (a representation of the DOM element); `adjacentTiles` (a record of the tiles above, below, to each side, and at each corner of each tile in the grid, calculated by a helper function); `isFlagged`, `clicked`, and `recursed`, all of which are Booleans to facilitate comparisons between tiles; and the `index`, placed here as well as on the DOM element to facilitate access whether approaching via DOM or through internal code.

At this point, the tiles are all blank and there are no mines.

### 2. Primary Click Events

`clickTile()`: the central interaction element of the game uncovers the clicked tile. If no tiles have been clicked, the game timer is started and mines are placed on the grid per the `populateMines()` and `placeMine()` functions. `placeMine()` pushes to the mines array a series of random indexes from the maximum number of tiles of the generated grid and will run again if the same index is generated twice, ensuring mines are not placed on the same tile twice. `populateMines()` runs `placeMine()` for as many mines as are needed. In `clickTile()`, populateMines() is run until the first tile clicked is neither adjacent to a mine nor a mine. In the original game, the first click is always a blank square. The `revealClicked()` function (see below) then runs.

If it is not the first click, then the `revealClicked()` function runs as long as the tile does not have a flag on it.

After every click, a check runs to see whether all tiles without mines have been clicked (which wins the game).

`flagTile()`: secondary interactive element allowing for placement of a flag to indicate that the user suspects a mine is beneath that tile. This runs the `addOrRemoveFlag()` function, which adds/removes a flag depending on current `isFlagged` status of the tile. This adds a class in the DOM (flag picture) to the tile and updates the mine counter display. A guard clause is also present to ensure that the first click is not an attempt to place a flagâ€”functionality from the original game again.

### 3. Gameplay Functions

`revealClicked()`: primary gameplay function reveals what is underneath the clicked tile as long as the tile has not been flagged. The tile object of the clicked tile in `tilesArray` is updated so `clicked === true`. It a mine is on that tile, `gameOver()` function (see below) runs. If the tile has 0 mines in any of the adjacent tiles, `revealExtended()` (see below) runs. Otherwise, a class with a depiction of a number of mines adjacent to that tile is added to the clicked tile.

`revealExtended()`: in the original game, clicking on an empty tile uncovers not only that tile but also the blank tiles around it, those blank tils in turn will act as if they have been clicked and uncover any blank tiles around it, and so on. This recursive functionality is stored in the `revealExtended()` function. This assesses the tiles adjacent to the initially clicked tile and, if one of the adjacent tiles is blank, runs the same assessment on that tile. As it checks, it marks the recursion check in the tile object so that tile is not assessed again so as to avoid too much recursion error. If an adjacent tile has a mine on it, then the function exits. If an adjacent tile is itself next to a mine, the appropriate class with the numerical depiction of the number of adjacent mines is placed.

For both these functions, the `adjacentTiles` property of each tile object in `tilesArray` is used alongside a helper function which tallies the number of mines present in the adjacent tiles, thereby determining which numerical depiction to assign.

### 4. Endgame Functions

`winGame()`: if all tiles without mines are clicked, the game is won. It is not necessary to place a flag on each mine. Indeed, you could go the whole game without placing a single flag and still win. On win, the timer stops, the smiley face is updated, and any tiles with mines are given a flag automatically.

`gameOver()`: if player clicks on a mine, that mine explodes (a picture of a mine on a red background) and the locations of the other mines are revealed (pictures of mines on grey background). If player has incorrectly flagged a tile as having a mine, another class is assigned which depicts a mine with a cross over it. Again, this mimics the operation of the original game.

For both of these functions, the grid becomes unclickable so no further action is possible until reset.

`reset()`: stops timer, resets displays and mine counts, draws a new blank minefield.

### 5. Drag & Drop

Purely aesthetic to mimic the behaviour of a Windows 95 desktop. Certain elements are designated draggable. Mousedown on those elements makes the other elements non-interactive (dragging one over the other causes a clash due to z-index values) and addictional `mousemove` and `mouseup` events are added to the element and to the wider document (mouseup on wider document because drag is limited to the dimensions of the depicted desktop, meaning the mouse may not be on the element when mouseup occurs).

Move functionality is calculated by measuring the difference between the original and new position of the mouse. This difference is then subtracted from the initial offset of the parent container of the draggable element. These are run through `minMax` functions to keep the draggable area confined to the depicted desktop. The `minMax` value is then passed through to inline CSS, updating the position of the window dynamically. After the first movement, the new position is reassigned as the original position, so that when more movement occurs, the calculation continues and dragging movement occurs dynamically. `travelling` class is added on move to facilitate proper aesthetics of desktop icon click (below).

Movement is stopped on `mouseup`, `travelling` class is removed and pointer events restored. `Mousemove` and `mouseup` events are removed as the last stage of the `mouseup` event.

### 6. Close Button, Desktop Icon, and Desktop Clock

To simulate original functionality, a close button is added to the "title bar" of the game. This adds `display: none` to the game container and resets the game, mimicking the closure of a program in Windows. The desktop icon is clickable and draggable. Double clicking restores the display and visibility of the game container.

A visual indication that the desktop icon is selected was added on click. Bug was found where dragging the desktop icon was perceived as a click and icon was highlighted as if it had been clicked without dragging. This was resolved by tracking travelling through addition of a class in the `moveElement()` function, allowing for distinction between a drag and a click in situ. Actual event used to mimic selection highlighting was `mousedown` as this was more practical for control flow.

Desktop clock at bottom right updates in real time by running simple `setInterval()` on DOM content load.

### 7. Mobile Design

Since mobile phones do not have right click functionality, a button was added to allow the player to toggle whether they were placing flags or uncovering tiles. As with the full-size game, flags cannot be placed without uncovering at least one tile first. In JS, toggling this button swaps the event handler functions (`clickTile`() and `flagTile()`) for the click event on each tile.

## CONCLUDING REMARKS

I was immediately drawn to recreating this game for my first JavaScript project as it evoked a number of childhood memories for me. This was likely the reason for the 90s aesthetic and design choices. I believe that the game functionality is an accurate representation of the original game, but I would welcome any observations or amendments from those who remember it better/differently.

This was a good introduction to simple recursion and the limits/functionality of same. While not part of the game, the challenges of mimicking Windows 95 dragging and selection functionality in a JS environment were particularly engaging and rewarding.

More than anything, I hope you enjoy the game and that it brings back some good childhood memories for you, too.

## FUTURE GOALS

To add 'Custom' functionality (where user can decide height/width/number of mines) in a way that integrates with the UI and dynamically works with the drag function. The former could be achieved with more "plastic" buttons on the "monitor" with a button to open a custom window, then plus and minus button for the width/height. A mathematical formula will be investigated for dynamically updating the min and max limits for drag function.
